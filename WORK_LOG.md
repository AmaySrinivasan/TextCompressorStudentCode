| Dec 3   |    8-9pm     | THought through all of the code and planned out my ideas based on what we talked about in class. Orgiinally tried utilizign the approach that Vikram suggested to the class about matching the values but couldn't figure out how to address the issue with the thing with how would you convert back. So I decided to rethink out the whole think. I came up with the ieda of frequency tables with the dictionary and sorting through it and then mathcing so that you aren't repearting all of the most frequently used words because those are added to a frequency table. This also had me thinking about using a hash table for the frequency table because that is something i can implement and then it allows my to insert in a better way. I mainly used this time to write out my thoughts and think through the problem set, although I did start implementing like a rough outline. |

Also, i started working on compress which ended up taking really really long as I got pretty confused in this with the implementation of the frequency table within compress. |

I thnk I have an interesting idea with the frequency tables, but I definetley don't think it is the most efficient an I am excited to see what Mr. Blick has in store for us. I think that I could've done this with a lot less liens of code, and it toook a really long tiem o implement everything into a dictionary so it was pretty frustrating. I can't wait to cut this down a lot |
